<p>
In 2024, the NYC Office of Nightlife <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/sbs/downloads/pdf/about/reports/nightlife-report-2023-24.pdf">reported</a> there are 6,000 new bars and clubs that have opened since the industry was experiencing mass closures and lack of employment during the pandemic in 2020.
</p> 
<p>
This number is record breaking, with 2024 being on track to surpass last year's average monthly employment rate in the nightlife industry by December, according to the <a href="https://dol.ny.gov/labor-statistics-new-york-city-region">New York State Department of Labor.</a> 
</p>

Co-owner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanleongnyc/">Nathan Leong</a> of El Grupo SN, a hospitality group that owns four venues in New York City including Somewhere Nowhere NYC, said his business has been “booming” after four years of rebuilding.
</p>
<p>
“I have more people on the team here than we ever had before, I probably onboard at least one new person to help us out every month. The industry is only up from here, at El Grupo we are confident we can open at least five new venues and do well if we keep going at this rate,” Leong said. 
</p>
<p>
Though 2024 isn't over yet, monthly employment averages so far are more than those recorded in 2023 consistently from January through September. New York’s nightlife industry is projected to continue growing as time passes.
